# Rat Race

## Classic arcade action!

The name of the game is Rat Race (the name of the project was chosen before I decided that).

You control a rat in a maze.  The rat must clear the maze of little bits of cheese while being chased by aggressive cats.  Each maze has big pieces of growth-hormone-laced cheese which temporarily turns the rat into a super rat that can chase and swallow the cats.  

Like a real rat race, once you clear the board, you have to race again.  But of course, somebody has moved the cheese(s) now.
